1 to export k8 config
~ aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name demo

2 To check connection to EKS cluster run the following command:
~ kubectl get svc (the external ip here is empty)

3 Create both deployment and the service objects. 
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml (for nginx deployment)
kubectl apply -f k8s/public-lb.yaml (for public load balancer deployment)

to see if nginx is running
kubectl get pods 

public loadbalancer now is connect to an external ip, exposing port 80 
while kubernets cluster exposes port 443
kubectl get svc

5 checking the loadbalancer in the aws console
you will find out this features
 - scheme : internet facing (this indicate that it is a public loadbalancer)

 Public loadbalaner : internet facing
 Private loadbalancer: internal
